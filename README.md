**Tytler** provides an assisted workflow to work with translations in both server side and client side react applications.

## Development

### Extension

To create a new version of the extension, run the following command:

```bash
npm run package
```

This will create a new version of the extension in the root folder.

Next, update the `install script` in the cli to use the new file
